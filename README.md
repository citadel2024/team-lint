## Description

1. Automated version management, push code or merge a PR to trigger a release.
2. Automatically generate a changelog, no need to write it separately.
3. Automatically publish to NPM (ðŸ˜… skipping the need to learn the npm package publishing process).
4. After publishing, a release notification comment is added to the corresponding PRs and issues, so you don't need to manually notify anymore.
